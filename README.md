A simple script to manage using a single ssh agent over any number of 
terminal sessions. There's other scripts that do this, but this one is 
specifically short and simple to make it easy to see all the nefarious 
things it doesn't do.

# Usage
Just add `eval $(path/to/jagent.sh)` to your `.bashrc` or equivalent.
